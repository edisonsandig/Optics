The system aims to provide the ASEAN dormitory a web based system that will automatically generate the monthly report and will provide the dormers an easy way to view their respective accounts such as the water, electric and rental fee. 
Also the system aims to provide the admin a system that will automatically create an event and announcement that will be posted on the web application. The said announcement will be automatically sent to the corresponding recipients.
Align to this are the following reports that the system can generate: the monthly attendance of the dormers, the monthly budget of the dorm, the expenditures, for repairs, and also report for the attendance during the check-in and check-out period.
